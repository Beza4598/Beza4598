### About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Beza Amsalu, a student at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science who's majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship. My passion for technology has been fueled by hands-on experience through various classes and internships, where I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end systems, using a diverse array of programming languages and tools. I'm particularly proficient in Java, Python, Haskell, and Javascript (React.JS), but I'm always eager to expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies and programming languages.
